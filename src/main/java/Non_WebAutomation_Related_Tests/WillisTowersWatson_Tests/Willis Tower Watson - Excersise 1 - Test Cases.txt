Task Part 1

Answer to the Questions:

	A - Using the database and the GUI, how would you test the functionality of this form?
	
		So, we will have a LOT of Test to cover at least the most critical parts of the application, still I will devide it in different parts to 
		have them Tested individually first and then do an Integration Testing among all the different "actors" -or parts- on the Application.
		
		UI - Mainly Frontend

		UI - Maintain Commission Rates
		=============================
		
			Note: On these Tests the main Strategy - on most of them - will be to apply the Boundary Testing Techniques to Test the output values testing before, at and after the limits set.
		
			Use Cases:
			==========
			
			Title: User set the Minium Commission Value
			==================================================
			1 - User Set the minimum Commission Value to '10'

			===========
			
			Title: User set an invalid Minium Commission Value
			==================================================
			1 - User Set the minimum Commision Value to '9'
			2 - Then performs a Currency Exchange with the commission set
			3 - The value of the conversion is the conversion itself plus the minimum 10.
			
			Expected result: Actually I dont have much Idea as what would happen on this scennario, as its not described on the Documentation, however it should be specified among the Tests to be performed.
			
			
			Title: User set the a Range of Commission Values - Test 4
			==========================================================
			1 - User set a range between 10 to 100 the Commission to be 5%

			Expected result: What would happen on this scennario? When its only defined a minimum, a range between the minimum and X, but when surpassing the X what should happen?
			
			
			
		Accessibility Testing:
		======================
		
			Tests:
			======
			
				- Verify if the application can be used by someone who is blind by verifiying that the Application can tell in an auditive way to the user what is going on.
				- Verify if the application can be used by someone who is Color blind by verifiying that all the fields and elements are being clearly defined and seen.
				
			
		
		If you were automating the testing of this form for regression test purposes, what would you hope the developer had done that would make the automation easier?
		===============================================================================================================================================================
		
			Answer: Locators. Give the WebElements IDs or Names at least. We can still work with CSS and XPaths, but for example, working with XPaths should be the very last resource
			as when using it, it takes longer to find the WebElement.
			
		If this application were used internationally, what further tests would you perform?
		====================================================================================

			Answer: We should be testing the Translations on the Application, since this is a KEY factor when having an application that will be used around the world.
			
			
		Looking at the screenshot of the form above, what user interface issues are immediately apparent (you may have mentioned some of these in previous answers)?
		=============================================================================================================================================================
		
			Answer: Well to be honest here are some - in my opinion - :
			
							- Unecesary Close button and the Exit at the toolbar
							- Which are the Mandatory fields - not specified on the UI
							- IT COULD be an issue in the case of Resizing the Window if the application is not responsive or if it doesnt display horizontal and verical scrolls
							- The Elements could be placed in a more friendly user way, e.g.: The Target Currency could be next to the Base currency
							- It could be nice to have some key-shortcuts for some of the options
							- The input at the Amount could be a MaskedTextbox defining the input format
